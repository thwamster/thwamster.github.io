\[9-4-2025] Hey Bearcats!

Peyton and I are happy to tell you that voting for the Class of 2029 ASWU Senate begins **tomorrow, September 5th** and continues until Monday, September 8th. Watch your emails over the next few days for official information from the elections commission. As there are four seats available in the Senate, you’ll be able to vote for multiple candidates through a selection-choice ballot. Peyton and I’s names will be separate, but you can **vote for both of us**!

\
Our platform is first and foremost based on **supporting students**. We’re committed to expanding accessibility and outreach in Willamette’s resources to ensure that they’re affordable and inclusive of all students. We want to communicate with you—hear your thoughts, ideas, and concerns about WU—to create the **best change possible**. However, transparency and clarity about what our student leaders are doing is a critical first step to making that possible, and we pledge to open those doors.

Our experience, skills, and active campaigning all prove that we’re the **best Senators for you**. If you have any questions about us, our positions, or our backgrounds, don’t hesitate to contact us or approach us in person!

# Vote Teddy & Peyton for Senator!

\[9-3-2025] Hello Class of 2029!

I’m Teddy Wachtler, and alongside Peyton Edmunds, I’m excited to tell you why we’re the **two best candidates** for the Fall 2025 ASWU Senate election.

We believe that student government should be transparent, genuine, and decisive. Currently, Willamette’s resources can be cryptic and inaccessible, and we’re committed to improving clarity in how decisions are made, how finances are managed, and most critically, how **students are supported**. 
\
\
\
We bring our leadership expertise to Willamette:

★ As the executive student delegate of her school, Peyton represented her student body to her district to fight a devastating $9 million budget deficit and utilized her negotiation prowess and analytical abilities to handle this immense and intricate conflict in the midst of a school merger. She rewrote the student council constitution and drew upon diverse perspectives from her peers to ensure low-income and marginalized students had an **equal opportunity** and to foster a more **resilient community**.

★ Faced with severe conservative backlash from their school, Teddy pioneered student activism for LGBTQ+ equality. They gathered a coalition of students and advocated for increased student outreach and access to mental health resources until their activism escalated to the upper administration. Using policy-making skills honed from high-level debate, their work forced the school to take action to **recognize and rectify discrimination**.
\
\
\
Together, we want to make sure **no student is left behind** at Willamette. As team captain and club president, repeat state champion and valedictorian, intern to a Senator and Eagle Scout, we have the experience to excel as **your** Senators. Most importantly, we’re determined to make opportunities at Willamette more **inclusive, affordable, and sustainable**. We’re here for you!

We’ll be around campus campaigning today and tomorrow, while these flyers are up—if you spot us, stop by and grab some starbursts!
